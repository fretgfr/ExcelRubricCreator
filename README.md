# About

This project started when I needed to create a grading rubric for a class that didn't update grades regularly but did provide me with the grades I had for completed assignments. 

## Usage

Either download one of the packaged builds that I've provided or download the script and run it. Please note that it requires the `openpyxl` Python library that can be installed using pip.

You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all dependencies.
